# About the project
This is my redesign on Midnight Racing Team's website which features minimalistic styling to give the "exclusive" feeling. 
Please show your support by reacting with `watch` or ‚≠ê

### Built With

* HTML + CSS
* Javascript

***
# **I. Landing Page**

The landing page features a simple animation forming the collage of the popular Midnight Racing Team cars, animated through the Javascript library AOS.

# **II. Password System**

The initial page on landing is a password page where you need the password to continue to enter the site. This is virtually the resemblence of how Midnight Racing Team (previously known as Midnight Club) only allowed specific people with fast cars to join. Password is Blackbird

# **III. Animations**

All animations are used from a js library called [AOS](https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/) (animate on scroll) which is both lightweight and beginners friendly.
